Floating Oil

Oil - Water Separation Visualizer
--
This program visualizes oil floating on water.

When I was a kid, I enjoyed combining and separating the oil floating on top of the beef seaweed soup commonly eaten in Korea.

However, my mother told me many times, "Don't play with your food." so I had to give up the big dream - "Uniting all the oils together".

So I made a replica of my soup in this program.

Features
--
Quite plausible visualization filters : You can disable these filters if you don't like them. but there will be only red and blue dots.

Variable simulation variables : You can set something about this simulation, such as  bowl size(simulation size), oil ratio, viscosity.

Limitable number of particles : You can limit the number of particles generated in case you accidentally set the bowl size too large.
(This program shows not bad performance for 2200 particles and the default limit is 2500.)

FPS counter : You can see FPS(Frames Per Second) of simulation.
