This program visualizes oil floating on water.

When I was a kid, I enjoyed combining and separating the oil floating on top of the beef seaweed soup.

But my mother told me "Don't play with your food.", so I had to give up the big dream - "Uniting all the oil blobs together".

So I made a replica of my soup in this program.

Features
--
### 1. Quite decent visualization filters
You can disable these filters if you don't like them. but there will be only red and blue dots.

### 2. Variable simulation variables
You can set something about this simulation such as  bowl size(simulation size), oil ratio, viscosity.

### 3. Limitable number of particles
You can limit the number of particles generated in case you accidentally set the bowl size too large.
(This program is tested for 2200 particles on my laptop and the default limit is 2500.)

Tested system : i7-7700HQ, 16GB RAM, Geforce GTX1060 mobile, Google Chrome 103.0.5060.53

### 4. FPS counter
You can see FPS(Frames Per Second) of simulation.

This program is using PixiJS - the HTML5 creation engine.

I did not test on Safari for iPhone and iPad.
